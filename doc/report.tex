    \section{Introduction}

    Surveillance is a powerful tool, used in various public settings to ensure safety of the public on a daily basis.
    CCTV, closed circuit television, is employed widely with operators having to comb through hours of footage everyday 
    to uphold security. This is a tedious task, and human error is inevitable. Posing the question, can we automate this 
    process?

    One of the many threats to public safety is unattended luggage, this is a common occurence which, at best, causes
    inconvenience, and at worst, could be placed for a more sinister purpose.

    An automated approach to detecting suspicious luggage could alleviate the burden on operators, allowing them to dedicate
    more attention to pressing matters; require smaller teams to monitor larger areas, saving resources; and reduce human error, 
    bolstering overall security.
