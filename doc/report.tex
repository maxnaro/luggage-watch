	\section{Introduction}

	Surveillance is a powerful tool, used in various public settings to ensure
	safety of the public on a daily basis. CCTV, closed circuit television, is
	employed widely with operators having to comb through hours of footage everyday
	to uphold security. This is a tedious task, and human error is inevitable.
	Posing the question, can we automate this process?

	One of the many threats to public safety is unattended luggage, this is a
	common occurence which, at best, causes inconvenience, and at worst, could be
	placed for a more sinister purpose. Numerous incidents at transportation hubs
	and public spaces have demonstrated the potential dangers of unattended luggage
	and bags, with counter terrorism authorities advising the public and security
	personnel to remain vigilant and report any suspicious
	items~\citep{protectuk2022unattended}. Historical acts of terrorism, such as
	the Boston Marathon bombing, have emphasised the importance of detecting
	suspicious items in crowded spaces, highlighting the need for reliable
	detection mechanisms in these scenarios.

	Compared to other threats, unattended luggage is distinct in its ability to be
	discrete. To the human eye, with low resolution CCTV footage, a security threat
	may be indistinguishable from legitimate items, presenting a unique challenge
	compared to more obvious security threats such as disorderly conduct. False
	positives can increase the burden on teams responsible for monitoring, being
	too relaxed could have dire consequences.

	Systems recording footage at all hours of the day generate an overwhelming
	amount of data, the sheer volume posing a significant challenge for operators
	to review on a regular basis. This implies a costly requirement for large teams
	of personnel manually monitoring the footage, diverting resources from other
	facets of security, increasing operational expenses, and potentially leading to
	fatigue-induced oversights.

	Automation in security is already a widely incorporated concept accross the
	public sector, with systems such as facial recognition and intrusion detection
	providing results that manual monitoring alone cannot achieve; at least without
	significant human-resource investment. An automated approach to detecting
	suspicious luggage could alleviate the burden on operators, allowing them to
	dedicate more attention to pressing matters; require smaller teams to monitor
	larger areas, saving resources; and reduce human error, bolstering overall
	security.

	Edge processing using embedded systems has become an increasingly viable, cost
	effective, and practical solution for surveillance applications. Versus a cloud
	solution, edge processing offers lower latency, by way of being situated
	physically closer to the data source; improved privacy, sensitive data remains
	on site and the onus is on the operator to secure it --- not a cloud provider;
	and network independence, there is no reliance on a stable internet connection
	just the local network~\citep{pamadi2025edgevscloud}. The proliferation of
	affordable, high-performance embedded hardware, with enhanced software support,
	has made a strong case for edge processing in surveillance; the benefits of
	cloud computing's scalability and power are minimised by new embedded
	solutions.

	Advances in computer vision technology and deep learning have made the issue of
	embedded suspicious luggage detection more tractable. Similar automation tasks,
	are being successfully implemented in real-world applications.

	Therefore, this project aims to design and implement an embedded system for
	suspicious luggage detection. The system will bridge the gap between academic
	research and practical deployment, focusing on real-time performance on edge
	devices. The target for the project is to create a deployable solution that can
	integrate with surveillance infrastructure, utilising an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
	Nano as a cost-effective piece of hardware suitable for the task.

	\section{Literature Review}

	\subsection{Core Concepts of Object Detection}

	Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and
	locating objects within an image or video frame.

	\subsection{Video Analysis, Temporal Modeling and Object Tracking}

	\subsection{Real-Time Processing on Edge Devices}

	\subsection{Existing Systems}

	This section explores existing research and reviews in the field of unattended,
	or suspicious, object detection using computer vision and deep learning
	techniques. This includes a broader view on machine learning techniques for
	suspicious object detection \citep{dubey2024critical}, as well as a specific,
	novel approach to abandoned object detection using deep learning methods
	\citep{qasim2024abandoned}. The main question of the review is to determining
	how the specific implementation choices tackle the general challenges posed.

	\subsubsection[A Critical Study on Suspicious Object Detection with Images and Videos Using Machine Learning Techniques]
	{\enquote{A Critical Study on Suspicious Object Detection with Images and Videos Using Machine Learning Techniques} \protect\citep{dubey2024critical}}

	Authors \citeauthor{dubey2024critical} provide a broad study of the field,
	reviewing machine learning techniques for detecting suspicious objects. The
	authors cover a range of detection methods, from static images, real-time
	videos, and via IoT systems.

	A pertinent point raised in this review are the challenges that researchers
	faced in this domain \enquote{illumination changes, occlusion, noise, poor
		resolution, and real-time processing complexities}.

	The review compares multiple deep learning models with the most promising
	results coming from Faster-RCNN, Mask-RCNN, and variants of YOLO. Despite the
	promise of these models, the authors conclude that many limitations are still
	faced, particularly in terms of accuracy in busy scenes.

	\subsubsection[Abandoned Object Detection and Classification Using Deep Embedded Vision]
	{\enquote{Abandoned Object Detection and Classification Using Deep Embedded Vision} \protect\citep{qasim2024abandoned}}

	The article by \citeauthor{qasim2024abandoned} present a novel approach for
	identifying abandoned objects in surveillance footage. It features a two-stage
	approach, the first stage employing a ConvLSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term
	Memory) model which combines the abilities of a CNN and LSTM to capture both
	spatial and temporal features from video data, classifying scenes as
	\enquote{suspicious} or \enquote{non-suspicious}; the second stage, given a
	suspicious scene, utilises a YOLOv8l model to classify the detected objects.

	\subsection{Model Optimisation Techniques}

	\subsection{Challenges in Surveillance Systems}

	\subsection{Identifying the Research Gap}

	The two studies provide an answer to the review's main question. The review by
	\citeauthor{dubey2024critical} establishes the persistent challenges of the
	domain: environmental factors, and, most critically for this project, the
	difficulty of \enquote{real-time processing complexities}
	\citep{dubey2024critical}. The implementation choices of researchers are a
	response to these challenges.

	A state-of-the-art example is presented by \citeauthor{qasim2024abandoned}, who
	tackle these challenges with a novel, specific implementation: a two-stage
	model \citep{qasim2024abandoned}. Their ConvLSTM classifier acts as an
	efficient first-pass filter, analysing spatio-temporal data to identify
	\enquote{suspicious} scenes. This implementation choice addresses the challenge
	of real-time processing by preventing the system from running the more
	computationally expensive YOLOv8l model on every single frame. This solution
	allows the system to achieve high accuracy (99.70\% for the localiser) by
	focusing resources only when necessary.

	However, this is where the research gap, and the justification for this
	project, becomes clear. While the \citeauthor{qasim2024abandoned} paper is
	titled \enquote{Using Deep Embedded Vision}, their experimental setup was
	conducted on a high-performance NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. This hardware,
	while having been superseded, remains a high-power, high-cost component not
	suitable for a typical, low-cost embedded application, revealing a gap between
	academic demonstration and practical, real-world deployment.

	Therefore, this project is justified as a critical investigation into the
	practical implementation and optimisation of an object detection model. It will
	tackle the \enquote{real-time processing complexities} identified by
	\citeauthor{dubey2024critical} by moving from a theoretical, high-performance
	environment to a constrained one.
