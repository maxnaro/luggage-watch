\section{Introduction}

This project aims to develop an embedded system that can detect suspicious, or unattended, luggage from CCTV footage.
The system will utilise computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify luggage distinctly from other objects in the scene.

Primarily, the use case is focused on train carriages, where unattended luggage can pose inconvenience for passengers and, at worst, security risks. 
However, the system will be adaptable for use in other environments, such as airports, train stations, and other public spaces.

\section{Objectives}

The main objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop deep learning software capable of detecting, and recognising, objects and people from a camera
    \item Integrate the software within an embedded system, Jetson Orin Nano
\end{itemize}
