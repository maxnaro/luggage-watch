  abstract       = {In this paper, we propose a system for the real-time automatic detection of abandoned luggage in an airport recorded by surveillance cameras. To do this, we use an adapted YOLOv11-s model and a proposed algorithm for detecting unattended luggage. The system uses the OpenCV library for the video processing of the recorded footage, a detector, and an algorithm that analyzes the movement of a person and their luggage and evaluates their spatial and temporal relationships to determine whether the luggage is truly abandoned. We used several popular deep convolutional neural network architectures for object detection, e.g., Yolov8, Yolov11, and DETR encoder–decoder transformer with a ResNet-50 deep convolutional backbone, we fine-tuned them on our dataset, and compared their performance in detecting people and luggage in surveillance scenes recorded by an airport surveillance camera. The fine-tuned model significantly improved the detection of people and luggage captured by the airport surveillance camera in our custom dataset. The fine-tuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models achieved excellent real-time results on a challenging dataset consisting only of small and medium-sized objects. They achieved real-time precision (mAP) of over 88%, while their precision for medium-sized objects was over 96%. However, the YOLOv11-s model achieved the highest precision in detecting small objects, corresponding to 85.8%, which is why we selected it as a component of the abandoned luggage detection system. The abandoned luggage detection algorithm was tested in various scenarios where luggage may be left behind and in situations that may be potentially suspicious and showed promising results.},
