This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

  abstract = {Object detection is one of the most important and challenging tasks of computer vision. It has numerous applications in the fields of agriculture, defence, retail markets and manufacturing units, transportation, social media platforms, medical, wildlife monitoring and conservation. This survey aims to give researchers a comprehensive understanding of the current state of object detection algorithms. In this review, object detection and its different aspects have been covered in detail. This review paper starts with a quick overview of object detection followed by traditional and deep learning models for object detection. The section on deep learning models provides a comprehensive overview of one-stage and two-stage object detectors. A detailed discussion is given of the transformer-based detectors and lightweight networks category. Additionally, the evaluation metrics used for object detection methods are discussed systematically. The best object detection algorithms for different applications are discussed at the end of the survey. This survey is useful for beginners who want to study different object detection algorithms and their use in different applications.}
